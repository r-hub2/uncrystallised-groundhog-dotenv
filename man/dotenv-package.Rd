\title{Load configuration parameters from .env into environment variables}
\description{
It has become a practice to store configuration parameters related
to a project, in a hidden file called \code{.env}, in the working
directory of a project, and then set them as environment variables.
}
\details{
This package loads the variables defined in the \code{.env} file
in the current working directory (as reported by \code{getwd}),
and sets them as environment variables.

This happens automatically when the \code{dotenv} package is loaded,
so the typical use-case is to just put a `library(dotenv)` code at the
beginning of your R script.

Alternatively a \code{dotenv::load_dot_env()} call can be used
to load variables from arbitrary files.

The format of the \code{.env} file is also a valid unix shell
file format, so e.g. in \code{bash} the environment variables
can also be set by running \code{source .env}.

See \code{\link{load_dot_env}} for the exact file format.
